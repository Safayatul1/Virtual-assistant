# Virtual-assistant
This is a virtual assistant created using Python.

The library I used are:

 1)Speech recognition (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
 
 2)text to speech (https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
 
 3)PyAudio (https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)

I name the program Jarvis... Huge fan of Tony Stark >>>

- With this virtual assistant we can ask for the current date and time
- Also, we can ask Jarvis to get information from Wikipadia
- lastly, we can request Jarvis to play something from Youtube.
