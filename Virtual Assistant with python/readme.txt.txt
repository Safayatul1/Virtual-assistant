This is a virtual assistant created using Python
The library I used are:
 1)Speech recognition (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
 2)text to speech (https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/) 
 3)PyAudio (https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)

I name the program Jarvis.... Huge fan of Tony stark >>>

- With this virtual assistan we can ask for current date and time
- Also, we can ask Jarvis to get inforation from wikipedia
- lastly, we can request Jarvis to play something form the Youtube.
